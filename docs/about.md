I am an Ethereum enthusiast with a deep love for all things servers. I started my journey with Bitcoin as a high schooler in 2011 and gradually made my way to Ethereum. I've incorporated Ethereum into my Master's thesis and loved the experience as much as to make it my full time job. I currently work in the DevOps team of the Ethereum Foundation. 

I'm also an avid photographer with a specific interest in Landscape and Travel photography. I'm a casual gamer, reader and TV show binger.
